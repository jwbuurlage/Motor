Build instructions
==================

SDL
---
For Mac or Linux: install the libsdl package

For Windows: go to http://www.libsdl.org/ and go to the download page. The link is at the left called 'SDL 1.2'.
Then download the file at 'Development Libraries' for Visual C++ 6.0 (this works with Visual C++ 2010).
Unzip the contents of the include directory to /include/SDL/ so that you get /include/SDL/SDL.h
(You might have to create the SDL folder manually)
